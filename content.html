            <p class="sectionTag text-small">The pyramids of Giza are a historical monument. They are present in the city of Giza, which is present in Egypt. There are three pyramids at Giza. The three pyramids are the Pyramid of Khufu, the Pyramid of Khafre, and the Pyramids of Menkaure. They were built 4500 years ago. The pyramid of Khufu is the highest of the other two pyramids. The Pyramid of Khufu is also called the Great Pyramid. The pyramids were built to preserve the bodies of dead pharaohs. These pyramids were one of the seven wonders of the ancient world.</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-small">There are many mysteries behind these pyramids. First, is that how were the pyramids built? We are thinking this because of the weight of a stone that was used to make the pyramid. The weight of the stone was around 4000 - 70000 tons. People think aliens have built the pyramids. Aliens could have advanced technology 4500 years ago. Second, the pyramids are aligned with the three stars of the Orion belt. People think aliens might have come from those three stars. Third, if you check the navigational center of the earth, it is the place where the pyramids of Giza are present. This is shocking because at that time people did not even discover that the earth was round! So how did they get to the geographical center of the earth? Fourth, the Great Pyramid of Giza's latitude and longitude is 29.9792° N, 31.1342° E. The latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza is the speed of light (if you don't consider the decimal point).</p>
